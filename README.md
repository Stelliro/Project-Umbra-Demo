**Project Umbra** is a proof-of-concept for **Low Probability of Intercept (LPI)** communications. It utilizes a neural codec to modulate high-fidelity imagery into standard audio `.wav` files that are statistically indistinguishable from random white noise.

> *"Hiding the content is cryptography. Hiding the existence of the message is steganography."*

## 🎯 Objectives & Performance

The goal was to transmit HD images through a "hostile" audio channel (static) without the signal being recognized as data.

*   **Fidelity:** Achieved **>40dB PSNR** (Visually Lossless) reconstruction on unseen datasets.
*   **Stealth:** The carrier signal is standard PCM Audio (WAV) sounding like Gaussian white noise.
*   **Security:** Demonstrated a **31dB Security Margin**. Unauthorized decryption attempts using incorrect seeds yield pure entropy (<10dB PSNR).

## 🛠️ How It Works (Methodology)

Umbra moves away from traditional LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography, which is fragile, and instead uses **Generative AI Signal Reconstruction**.

### 1. Chaos-Modulated Encoding
The source image is not simply hidden; it is transmuted. The pixel data is flattened and subjected to a chaotic permutation layer defined by a cryptographic seed. This spreads the image energy across the entire frequency spectrum, effectively "bleaching" the structural information into noise.

### 2. The "God Gene" Discovery
The decoder does not use standard error correction. Instead, it uses a **Neural Denoising Autoencoder** tuned via Evolutionary Algorithms.
Over **200+ generations**, a genetic algorithm hunted for a specific set of hyperparameters (The "God Gene") that allows the AI to hallucinate the original image back into existence *only* when the noise pattern aligns with the authorized key.

### 3. Audio Bridge
The resulting data stream is normalized and encapsulated into a 16-bit PCM WAV container. To an outsider (or a spectral analyzer), the file appears to be a recording of thermal noise or static.

### Interface
![Interface](path/to/your/interface.png)

### 1. Transmitter (Encoder)
1.  Click **[ LOAD IMAGE ]** and select any PNG or JPG.
2.  The system will instantly modulate the image into the noise stream.
3.  Click **▶ PLAY NOISE** to hear the carrier signal.
4.  Click **💾 SAVE .WAV** to export the encrypted audio file.

### 2. Receiver (Decoder)
1.  Click **[ LOAD .WAV ]**.
2.  Select a file generated by Umbra.
3.  Click **🔓 DECODE SIGNAL**.
4.  If the internal Neural Key matches, the image will be reconstructed.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Research Notes

*   **Audio Compression:** The current prototype relies on lossless WAV. Converting the carrier to MP3/AAC introduces compression artifacts that degrade the neural reconstruction (creating "deep fried" visual artifacts).
*   **Single-Key Prototype:** This build utilizes a hardcoded "Universal Key" for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, Diffie-Hellman key exchange would generate unique seeds per transmission.
